        <p>Top Light Novels is a fan-curated platform created to celebrate and share the best English-translated light novels.</p>
        <p>We strive to offer a visually appealing, easy-to-use, and regularly updated reading experience for all light novel fans.</p>
        <p>Greetings to all of my fellow students and respected professor.
        I warmly welcome you to my website, a personal project born from one of my favorite hobbies â€” reading light novels. As someone who spends a lot of time exploring fantasy, action, and mystery stories, I decided to turn that passion into a website for the Website Design and Development module, guided by Mr. Kanaksabee, during my first year, second semester.
        This site showcases a selection of English-translated light novels, allowing readers to explore summaries, cover art, and genres. The goal was to create a clean, user-friendly platform with a modern design.
        While developing the site, I learned how to structure HTML pages, style them using CSS (including responsive design and dark mode), and add interactivity using JavaScript. This project also helped me understand layout techniques, accessibility, and how to make a site more engaging.
        Thank you for visiting. I hope you enjoy exploring the novels as much as I enjoyed building this website.</p>
